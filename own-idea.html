          <pre id="sharePrompt" class="prompt-text">Step 0: Ideation Clarity:

Write one paragraph on why this idea chose you.
(This anchors your voice emotionally before all structure.)

✏️ Template: “Why This Idea Chose Me”

This idea first came to me when ______________________________ (a brief moment, memory, or situation that sparked it).

At that time, I was feeling ______________________________ (emotion — confused, restless, inspired, curious, etc.), and I noticed ______________________________ (a small realization or pattern that caught your attention).

Since then, this thought has kept returning whenever ______________________________ (specific times, challenges, or reflections that bring the idea back).

I think it chose me because ______________________________ (why you personally relate — something you’ve lived, felt, or keep learning).

I want to share it because ______________________________ (why others might need this — what you hope they’ll gain or feel).

Writing about it feels ______________________________ (choose one or two emotions — peaceful, exciting, honest, necessary, healing), and I believe that’s why this idea keeps asking to be written.

Prompt1:

✏️ Prompt for Step 1️⃣: Starting from the Core Transformation

I have a mini-book idea forming in my mind, but it’s still vague.
I want to clarify its core transformation — the one small, meaningful change this book will teach or inspire.

Please help me identify and refine it by answering the following:
1️⃣ Based on my rough idea: [Describe your rough idea or feeling here — e.g., “I want to write about finding peace in chaos” or “something about emotional balance in daily life.”]
2️⃣ Suggest 3–5 possible One Small Transformation statements in the format:
“From [current state] → to [new empowered state].”
3️⃣ Briefly explain the emotional or practical benefit of each transformation — what would readers feel or gain after that change?
4️⃣ Recommend which transformation seems strongest as a mini-book foundation and why.

Keep your answer concise but insightful — the goal is to find one clear transformation that’s simple, relatable, and worth building a whole mini-book around.

Prompt2:

🧭 Prompt for Step 2️⃣: Title Discovery

I’ve now clarified my mini-book’s One Small Transformation, which is:

“From [current state] → to [new empowered state].”

Please help me discover the best possible title and subtitle ideas for this mini-book.

1️⃣ Suggest 5–7 potential titles, each under 7 words, that sound catchy, emotionally appealing, and benefit-driven — something that would attract my ideal reader on Gumroad or Kindle.

2️⃣ For each title, include a possible subtitle (10–15 words max) that clearly communicates what the reader will learn or feel.
Example format →
Title: Mini Book of Balance
Subtitle: Practical ways to find calm and joy in busy days.

3️⃣ For each title, briefly explain what tone or reader emotion it evokes (e.g., calm, focused, inspired, grounded, hopeful).

4️⃣ Recommend which 1–2 titles feel the strongest fit for my chosen transformation — and explain why (based on clarity, emotional alignment, and audience appeal).

5️⃣ (Optional Add-On for extra insight) For the strongest title, suggest 2–3 possible cover taglines — short 1-line hooks that could appear under the title or on the book cover, such as:
• “Simple mindfulness for real life.”
• “Calm doesn’t take time — it takes presence.”
• “Small pauses that change busy days.”

Keep the tone aligned with the Lifestyle & Self-Care niche — calm, practical, grounded, and human.
Avoid cliché or overused self-help terms like “unlock,” “manifest,” or “achieve.”

🎯 Goal: Find one title–subtitle pair that feels emotionally true, clearly communicates the book’s value, and is market-ready for Gumroad or Kindle.

Prompt3:

✏️ Step 3️⃣ Prompt: Decide How Many Chapters You Need

I’ve now defined my mini-book’s One Small Transformation, which is:

“From [current state] → to [new empowered state].”

Please help me decide how many chapters this transformation needs — not too many to feel overwhelming, but enough to make the reader’s journey feel real and complete.

1️⃣ Suggest the ideal number of chapters (between 3 and 7) for this transformation.

2️⃣ Briefly explain why that number works — how it matches the emotional or practical depth of the topic.

3️⃣ Describe the reader’s emotional or learning journey across those chapters — how they move from the starting struggle to the final empowered state.

4️⃣ Suggest a tentative one-line focus for each chapter (a short phrase describing the chapter’s role — not full titles yet).
Example format:
• Chapter 1: Realizing it’s possible
• Chapter 2: Trying it in daily life
• Chapter 3: Making it a habit

5️⃣ Recommend what type of chapter structure fits this specific topic — for example:
• “Concept → Practice → Reflection” (great for mindfulness, self-care, or habits)
• “Myth → Truth → Action” (effective for mindset or belief change)
• “Problem → Understanding → Application → Integration” (for process-based learning)

6️⃣ (Deeper insight add-on) Describe what the reader should feel at the end of each chapter — for example: “relieved,” “hopeful,” “curious,” “empowered,” etc.

Keep your answer focused on the logic and emotional flow of transformation, not on formatting or design.

🎯 Goal: To understand how many chapters this book truly needs, what each chapter contributes to the reader’s journey, and how their feelings evolve from start to finish.

Prompt4:

✏️ Step 4️⃣ Prompt: Define Chapter Roles & Structure

I’ve already identified my mini-book’s One Small Transformation, which is:

“From [current state] → to [new empowered state].”

I’ve also decided the tentative number of chapters and their one-line focuses (from Step 3).

Now, please help me define and detail the role of each chapter and how it should be constructed to guide the reader through this transformation.

1️⃣ For each chapter, describe its specific role in the transformation journey — what shift, realization, or skill the reader gains at that stage.

2️⃣ Explain how each chapter should be constructed according to its role, including:
• Recommended structure (flow of sections such as: Opening → Insight → Example → Practice → Reflection → Takeaway)
• Suggested pacing (fast / slow / balanced)
• Appropriate tone (reassuring, energetic, reflective, gentle, etc.)
• Suitable types of examples (personal stories, relatable daily moments, small research facts, guided scenes, etc.)
• Effective teaching style (story-based, conceptual, experiential, or instructional).

3️⃣ Describe the reader’s emotional progression across chapters — how they feel after finishing each one (e.g., relieved, hopeful, curious, empowered, peaceful).

4️⃣ Recommend whether the book would benefit from short action steps or micro-exercises inside each chapter, and if so, specify where they should appear (after the key insight, at the end, or both).

5️⃣ Summarize how all the chapters together form a cohesive transformation arc — what invisible thread or emotional rhythm connects the beginning to the end.

6️⃣ (For deeper creative clarity) For each chapter, suggest one anchor phrase or guiding metaphor that captures its emotional or conceptual essence — for example:
• “Planting the seed” for the first awareness chapter
• “Building the bridge” for the practice chapter
• “Living the rhythm” for the integration chapter

These metaphors will later help in writing, visual design, and tone consistency.

🎯 Goal: To create a complete “Transformation Architecture” — where each chapter has a clear purpose, teaching method, tone, and emotion, all building toward the One Small Transformation.

Keep your answer focused on the logic, structure, and reader experience, not formatting or word count yet.


Prompt5:

✏️ Step 5️⃣ Prompt: Build the First Outline

I’ve already defined my mini-book’s One Small Transformation, the number of chapters, and each chapter’s purpose and structure.

Now, please help me build the first working outline for this mini-book — a clear, logical flow that shows how the reader moves through the transformation.

1️⃣ Create a chapter-by-chapter outline, listing all chapter numbers and tentative working titles (these can be refined later).

2️⃣ Under each chapter title, include:
• A 1–2 sentence summary of what happens or what the reader learns.
• The core takeaway or insight for that chapter.
• The reader’s emotional shift (how they feel by the end of it).

3️⃣ Include a short intro section (the promise and purpose of the book) and a short closing section (the integration or lasting takeaway).

4️⃣ Make sure the chapters flow naturally — each one building on the last — and show how the reader gradually moves from the “before” state to the “after” state.

5️⃣ Recommend a working subtitle for the whole book, based on this flow (if it has evolved from earlier title discussions).

6️⃣ (Optional, for deeper development) For each chapter, suggest 1 potential practice, reflection, or micro-action idea that could later be expanded in Step 6.

Keep your focus on the logic, clarity, and emotional continuity — not detailed subpoints or formatting yet.

🎯 Goal: To produce a concise but complete first outline that shows the structure and emotional rhythm of the entire book — a roadmap I can refine into the final detailed outline next.


Prompt6:

✏️ Step 6️⃣ Prompt: Build the Final Outline

I’ve already created the first working outline for my mini-book, which includes chapter titles, purposes, and the flow of transformation.

Now, please help me build the final, detailed outline — the complete writing roadmap for this mini-book.

1️⃣ For each chapter, provide a clear internal structure, including:
• 3–5 subheadings or sections in logical sequence (e.g., Opening Insight → Practical Guidance → Real-Life Example → Practice → Reflection → Takeaway).
• A short description (1–2 sentences) of what each sub-section covers.

2️⃣ For each chapter, include:
• The key message or insight the reader should remember.
• The reader’s emotional progression within that chapter (e.g., from overwhelmed → to curious → to confident).
• 1 practice or micro-action idea (that fits naturally at the end or middle).
• 1 reflection question (short and thought-provoking).

3️⃣ Suggest how to open and close the Introduction and Conclusion sections:
• Introduction: What promise and context to set for the reader.
• Conclusion: How to summarize the transformation and motivate continuation.

4️⃣ Maintain consistent tone and teaching style throughout the outline: calm, grounded, practical, and empathetic — suitable for the Lifestyle & Self-Care niche.

5️⃣ (Optional for deeper creative alignment) For each chapter, suggest:
• A symbol, metaphor, or visual cue that could later inspire design or cover art (e.g., “a growing seed,” “steady breath,” “open window”).
• A brief transition line or idea showing how this chapter naturally leads into the next.

🎯 Goal: To produce a comprehensive, chapter-by-chapter writing outline — complete with subheadings, key ideas, emotional rhythm, and actionable elements — ready for Step 7 (creating the formatted Word manuscript template).

Keep your focus on clarity, flow, and teaching impact, not paragraph-level writing or design yet.


Prompt7:

✏️ Step 7️⃣ Prompt: Generate the Pre-Formatted Word (.docx) Template

I’ve now completed my mini-book’s final detailed outline (including chapters, subheadings, key ideas, practices, and reflections).

Please generate a ready-to-fill Microsoft Word (.docx) manuscript template, customized for this specific mini-book and transformation.

1️⃣ Structure the document according to the final outline:
• Include title page, introduction, all chapters (with their section headers and placeholders), and the conclusion.
• Use proper heading levels (Heading 1 for chapters, Heading 2 for sub-sections).

2️⃣ Add clear placeholder text under each heading so I can start writing directly — for example:
“✍️ Write 2–3 paragraphs introducing this idea here.”

3️⃣ Format the manuscript professionally for Gumroad / Kindle PDF export:
• Font: Playfair Display or Georgia for headings, Lato / Open Sans for body text.
• Font size: Headings 16–18 pt; Body 12 pt; Line spacing 1.4–1.5.
• Margins: 1 inch all around; Page size: A5 or 6×9 inches.
• Apply consistent spacing before and after headings.

4️⃣ Add visual placeholders where I can later include:
• 🌿 Exercise boxes (use shaded paragraphs)
• 💭 Reflection boxes (leave 3–5 dotted lines for writing space)
• ✨ Takeaway lines (italicized or soft-green text)

5️⃣ Insert small section dividers or icons (like 🌿 ✨ 💭) between major parts to create visual breathing space.

6️⃣ Include a short “Notes for Writer” section at the top of the file with reminders about:
• Tone (warm, calm, practical, human)
• Ideal word counts per chapter (approx. 1,000–1,200 words)
• How to fill each section (Opening → Insight → Example → Practice → Reflection → Takeaway).

7️⃣ Save the final output as a downloadable .docx file ready for immediate use.

🎯 Goal: To produce a fully formatted, editable Word manuscript that mirrors the structure of my final outline — so I can begin writing directly and later export it as a polished Gumroad-ready PDF.

Keep the design minimal, calming, and professional, aligned with the Lifestyle & Self-Care niche aesthetic.


Step 8: Reflection & Refinement

After finishing your manuscript, write one page titled “What I Learned While Writing This.”
(This deepens your authenticity for the next book.)

✏️ Step 8 — What I Learned While Writing This

Use this after finishing any manuscript or mini-book.
You can fill it in digitally or print it and keep it in a “Writer’s Growth Journal.”
